**INTRODUCTION:**
-----------------

The heat control system is basically used to control the temperature inside a car. Whenever the user or driver gets seated inside the car, the button sensor gets activated. After that, the user gets access to turn on the heater. The temperature sensor monitors the temperature and sends the analog value to the microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the analog input of the temperature sensor and outputs a temperature value through serial communication. All the activities of the control system are performed on the microcontroller, Atmega328.

**FEATURES:**
--------------

Driver has the acess to modify te temperature.

Low cost.

With the help of driver, heater generate heat accordingly.

**SWOT Analysis:**
------------------

Strengths:

System can control Temperature

Weakness:

The system can be used where the temperature is very low.

Oppurtunities:

It can be replaced heater with air conditioner.

Threats:

Not suitable for high temperature
